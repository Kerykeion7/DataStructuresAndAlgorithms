# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to this repository.

There are however a few guidelines I want you to follow before contributing and creating PR's.

- Keep your C# code clean.
- Keep the directory folders clean.
- Carefully read the Issue requirements and follow them thoroughly before submitting a PR, else the PR will not be valid.
- Do not just bluntly copy and paste code, else the PR will not be valid.
- When submitting a PR make sure it is obvious for the maintainers which issue you tackled.
- When tackling an issue do this on a new branch of which the name contains your Github user name and the specific issue your tackling. for example: Kerykeion_#22_branch.
