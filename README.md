# Data-Structures And Algorithms

This is a repository where I personally learn to create my own implementations of Data-Structures and Algorithms in C#.
The repository is just starting so there are more Data-Structures and Algorithm implementations yet to come.

Also I let this repository count for the hacktoberfest to give others a chance to learn something about Data-structures and algorithms and at the same get their required PR's

Try not to cheat and copy paste code, but try to do it on your own together with the needed research ofcourse.

Good luck and have fun.
