# Data-Structures And Algorithms

This is a repository where I personally learn to create my own implementations of Data-Structures and Algorithms in C#.
The repository is just starting so there are more Data-Structures and Algorithm implementations yet to come.

I have started with the Stack Data-Structure and have created an Issue concerning the aforementioned Data-Structure where you can also try to create your own implementation.
You can find the issue here https://github.com/Kerykeion7/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms/issues/5

An issue for implementing a Dynamic Array can be found here https://github.com/Kerykeion7/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms/issues/8

Try not to cheat and copy paste code, but try to do it on your self together with the needed research ofcourse.

Good luck, for you and for me, because in al honesty I am a newbie myself to this so do not feel you can not do this or it is too hard, just do.

# Get Started
- Fork this repository
- Clone the forked repository to your IDE
- Create a new branch to save your work upon
- Create a pull request if your implementation works
- Wait for my response :-)
