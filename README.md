# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

This is a repository where I personally learn to create my own implementations of Data-Structures and Algorithms.
The repository is just starting so there are more Data-Structures and Algorithm implementations to come.

I have started with the Stack Data-Structure and have created an Issue concerning the aforementioned Data-Structure where you can also try to create your own implementation.
https://github.com/Kerykeion7/DataStructuresAndAlgorithms/issues/5
Try not to cheat and copy paste code, but try to do it on your self.

Good luck, for you and for me, because in al honesty I am a newbie myself to this.
